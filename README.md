# Visualizing similarity of a brain neuron network via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)

This repository hosts the final project for Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra courses at Fulbright University Vietnam, Fall Semester 2020.
I implemented K-Means spectral Clustering and Louvain Community Detection algorithms to cluster neurons under supervised and unsupervised regimes. Similarity of every neuron pair is determined by the Bhattacharyya distance of the parameters yielded from fitting HMMs to the neuron sp
